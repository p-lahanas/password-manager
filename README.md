# Password-Manager
A simple password manager which uses hashing and encryption for security

## Getting Started
Ensure the following libraries are installed before running:  
-cryptography  
-hashlib  
*all other libraries used should be included in the python standard libraries<br>  
To get started, first decide on an admin password. Run the pass_hash.py file to generate the corresponding hash. Paste this hash at the top of the main.py file inside the HASHED_ADMIN constant. 

### Example installation - (open your python package manager (or cmd) and enter the following:
```
pip install cryptography
```
## Built With
* [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) - Used to encrypt the passwords
* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#module-hashlib)- Used to hash service names and admin password
